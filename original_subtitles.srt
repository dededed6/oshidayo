1
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,996
Time to talk about something big.

2
00:00:11,065 --> 00:00:12,000
Introducing Perks.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,160
This is the most significant innovation to core gameplay

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,840
since Overwatch launched in 2016.

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:21,440
This is more than just an update.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,226
It's a radical shift in how you experience gameplay.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,875
Perks are upgrades to your hero's kit that unlock during the game.

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:32,340
They provide an additional strategic layer,

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,715
allowing you to alter your playstyle and adapt to situations.

10
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:37,482
Throughout the match,

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,548
you'll level up your hero two times,

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,400
unlocking one minor perk and one major perk.

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,522
The first time you level up,

14
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,260
you'll get a choice between two minor perks.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,140
We positioned minor perks as lighter upgrades.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:53,680
They're like a little boost to warm you up,

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,698
from cooldown reductions to small passives

18
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,939
that keep things balanced but exciting.

19
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,515
Once you hit your major perk level,

20
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,180
you'll get to choose between two powerful upgrades.

21
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,980
Then you fine-tune your playstyle for the rest of the match.

22
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,820
Major perks are gameplay-shifting additions to your hero's kit,

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:18,468
changing your core loop and redefining what your hero is capable of.

24
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,860
Let's look at an example now with Orisa.

25
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,100
When you level up Orisa to level two,

26
00:01:25,565 --> 00:01:29,200
your minor perk choice will be between heat reduction on your primary

27
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,193
fire or the ability to briefly tank burst damage with Fortify.

28
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:35,520
Are you facing down a Junkrat and

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,400
want to be able to survive his tire?

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,400
The upgrade to Fortify might be a great choice.

31
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,180
The fun really gets going when you

32
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,700
get to your major perk at level three,

33
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:45,860
though.

34
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,988
Here, Orisa gets the choice between

35
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:51,420
a higher impact energy javelin or swapping

36
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,360
out her javelin spin for a protective barrier.

37
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,960
Here's another example of what you can

38
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,464
expect with major perks with Torbjorn.

39
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,560
For Torb's major perk options,

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,820
you get to choose between two wild upgrades for your turret.

41
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:07,800
The first perk option is allowing you to upgrade

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,306
your turret to level three when activating Overload,

43
00:02:11,692 --> 00:02:13,640
drastically shifting your turret's

44
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,392
threat level as it rips through enemies.

45
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,500
The second perk option is if you're feeling

46
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:18,920
a little cheeky,

47
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:22,200
upgrading your turret to now stick on walls.

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,254
With this added flexibility,

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,860
Torbjorn can take different angles and even

50
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,543
surprise opponents with sneaky turret placement.

51
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:29,992
Finally,

52
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,348
let's round it out with Ana. Ana's first major perk

53
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,360
choice upgrades her sharpshooting capabilities,

54
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,315
allowing her to headshot enemies.

55
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,508
Be careful, Widowmaker.

56
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,092
You might lose this sniper duel.

57
00:02:43,051 --> 00:02:43,160
Then,

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,376
if you're playing Ana and having a hard time getting Dovon,

59
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,319
you might want Ana's second

60
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,212
major perk option.

61
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,615
Give yourself nano boost when it's activated on an ally.

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,160
Now that's a way to turn a fight.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,840
When designing perks,

64
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,428
we wanted to expand and elevate what your heroes are capable of.

65
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:05,480
We are looking for a system that we can layer on top of your

66
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:09,480
normal Overwatch gameplay and offer choice from match to match.

67
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,060
We plan on adjusting perks on a regular cadence with bigger

68
00:03:14,165 --> 00:03:17,160
system refreshes happening in the middle of the year.

69
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,845
The choice you make with perks will impact the battlefield,

70
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:26,580
offering new opportunities to outplay enemies and support your team.

71
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,760
You'll get to experience the next era

72
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,680
of Overwatch 2 when Season 15 launches.
